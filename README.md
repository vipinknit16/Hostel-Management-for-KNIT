# Hostel-Management-for-KNIT
Looking upon the tedious system of hostel allotment in our college, we developed a Hostel Allotment Application using J2EE MVC Framework where a student can login and fill three choices for room priority wise, after everyone has filled their choices the room could be allotted at one go by the admin i.e automatically room will be allotted on the merit basis.
